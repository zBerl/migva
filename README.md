Migva: Mental Illness and Gun Violence Awareness

About

Welcome to Migva, a project born out of a deep concern for the issues surrounding mental health and gun violence. Conceived during an HTML/CSS class, Migva is more than just a final project—it's a heartfelt endeavor to make a difference. Our aim is to shed light on the often-overlooked connection between mental illness and gun violence, striving to create a world where understanding and empathy prevail.
